      The reason for taking this class was to see where my communication flaws
        were, and I don't like what they are. However, I want to advance in my
        career. I want to be closer to my son, and I want people to know it's
        easy to communicate with me. I was a teacher for 14 years, and it was
        easy because I taught a subject, Life and Physical Science, I love. It
        was easy for me, but it may not have been easy for my students. Now, I
        teach new employees on the unit. I always have great reviews, but not so
        great reviews as a coworker. I have a great quality which is being
        direct,but my delivery needs work. For instance, my delivery could use
        more and better eye contact with direct communication. I have a tendency
        to show my emotions in my face that are not favorable, and I'm not proud
        of it. For instance, the charge nurse is new and unfamiliar with things.
        Another nurse called to ask her for help calling a doctor, and the
        charge nurse said she would help. The charge nurse hung up the phone,
        and stated that she didn't know how to do it. I happened to be near,
        turned to her, and gave a face that stated ``what''. The charge nurse
        looked down. I felt bad. So I apologized for the look on my face, and
        stated I would help her know how to call a doctor. Later, we talked
        about how that situation was never brought to her before, but everyone
        on the floor needs to show compassion and patience with her. Afterwards,
        I went to the nurse that called her, and I instructed her what to do as
        well. It was a simple solution in the end. So instead of frowning or
        making a face at someone, maybe I can ask an open ended question to
        understand the situation better, and then I can have input on how to
        make things better.

      I carry a list with me almost always. It may be a list of groceries, a
        to-do list around the house, or a to-do list for work. It's how I keep
        my thoughts organized. For the items on the list, I can multitask those
        to complete duties assigned. When someone wants to add to the list while
        I'm multitasking, I'm less receptive. I say sometimes,
        ``walk and talk''. It reads rude as I write it, but at the time it's
        happening it doesn't. I want to learn to stop for just a second to
        listen, but I feel I will get out of rhythm and things will get chaotic.
        Things won't get chaotic, but I still feel that way. When a coworker and
        my brother stops to listen to me talk, it seems so easy and effortless,
        and it makes me feel good. Respected. They are confident, and I can
        tell. Hence, I have a plan. If I'm in the zone, I can ask the person to
        wait just a second so I can stop, grab paper and pencil, and begin to
        listen.

      Learning these communicative skills will definitely put me at the top,
        and, undoubtedly, be the hardest things I will ever learn to do in five
        weeks.
